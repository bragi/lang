h1. Specs

Spec = Object new
Spec do(
  describe = macro(
    
    description = call arguments first

)


h1. Last Message In Code (Done!)

Watch out for last message in methods and macro. It can be EndMessage and should not be evaluated if is not explicit:

  method(
    "Hello world"
  )

evaluates to "Hello world", while:

  method(
    "Hello world".
  )

evaluates to self.

Strip implicit EndMessages from end of code, possibly in parser.
